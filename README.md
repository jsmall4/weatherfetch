# weatherfetch

# Project Description:

To create an application that displays the current weather and future 5 day forecast for the city searched for by the user. It should contain a search box which will then be saved to local storage so the user can recall the information without searching the city name again, they can simply selecte from an ordered list of recent searches.

# Criteria:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

# How to use the WeatherFetch application:

Click the search box to type in the city name you wish to search. The current weather will be displayed in the top box, the 5 day forecast will be displayed below it. The entry will then be populated in a list if you wish to recall that city.

# Challenges:

Couldn't get the UV Index to change colour related to how low/high the index was.
